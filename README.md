<h2>Just Coding and Tinkering.</h2>
<p>I'm not looking for a "day job", I enjoy coding as a hobby, but I do some contract work here and there, so this isn't some <em>"Awesome Code Showcase"</em>, it's just some of the stuff I've come up with.</p>
<h2><em>Decisions decisions...</em></h2>
<p>I work in both PHP and Bash a lot, so I tend to use them together with exec() or shell_(exec) if I want to use them on a website or just in the back-end.<br>
The majority of my web development is based around getting top ten results on the big search engines and although I'm rebuilding my last CMS (H2SEO) with the same <em>"Black Hat"</em> techniques, it's going to be a minute before I really dig back in to rebuilding old tech.</p>
